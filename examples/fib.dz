# In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that
# each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is
#
# F(0) = 0
# F(1) = 1
# F(n) = F(n − 1) + F(n − 2)

def fib(n) {
    if n 3 < {
        n;
    } or {
        fib(n 1 -) fib(n 2 -) +;
    };
}

def main() {
    fib(10); # Exit with code 89
}
